### GitHub workflow

As in QM, we will work with GitHub. I assume that by now you downloaded and installed R and Rstudio and have your personal GitHub account.

**All of you who did not take QM in 2023 should receive an e-mail with instructions on how to set-up your GitHub account. If this is not the case by Friday: Send either one of us an e-mail after this class.**

The course has its own page on GitHub, you can find it here: [https://github.com/uni-mannheim-aqm-2024](https://github.com/uni-mannheim-aqm-2024). This is the place where you can find all relevant materials for the lab sessions. It is also the place where you download and hand-in your homework assignments. 

For those of you who are new to GitHub here is how you will get your materials:

#### Get the URL of the repo for the current week

Go to [https://github.com/uni-mannheim-aqm-2024](https://github.com/uni-mannheim-aqm-2024) and click on the repository for the current week. Now, click on the green **Clone or download** button and select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

  4. In the next window, select `Git`.
  5. In the final window, paste the repo URL you grabbed from GitHub in the `Repository URL` window. Click on `Browse` to select the folder on your computer where you want to store the project.
  6. Click on `Create Project`.
